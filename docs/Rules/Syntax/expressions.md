# Expressions

## Introduction

An expression is the living pulse of computation in your program, the embodied soul of meaning in a line of code. It is everything that speaks a value when questioned, everything that yields meaning when evaluated. Like a declarative sentence in natural language that carries a judgment or news that informs the listener, an expression carries a value that the context awaits to build upon for its decision or action.

An expression might be a pure, static number like (42), a dynamic arithmetic operation like (5 + 3), a function call that returns a treasure of meaning, or a logical comparison that reveals truth or falsehood like (x > 10).

> Every expression was born to be evaluated, and every evaluation produces a value - this is its covenant and pledge from which it never deviates.

> An expression always answers when asked: "What is your value?" - and in this answer lies the completeness of its meaning and the fulfillment of its purpose.

## Conclusion

Expressions are the language of computation in Kemet, and the tools for building meaning in your program. From the simplest literal constant to the most complex compound expression, every expression carries a value and contributes to the fabric of the complete program.

Understanding expressions, their precedence, and how to compose them is the key to writing clear, effective, and error-free code. Use them wisely, and let every expression convey your intent with clarity and forthrightness.
